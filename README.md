# Sorting Algorithms 📚

Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques used in computer science to rearrange the elements of a list or array into a specific order (typically ascending or descending). Efficient sorting is crucial for optimizing the performance of other algorithms that require sorted data as input. Here are some common sorting algorithms along with related LeetCode problems:

## Common Sorting Algorithms ⚙️

- **Bubble Sort** 🌟: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort** 🔄: Divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region, repeatedly selecting the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moving it to the sorted region.
- **Insertion Sort** 📥: Builds the sorted array one item at a time, picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position in the already sorted part of the array.
- **Merge Sort** 🧩: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Quick Sort** ⚡: Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
- **Heap Sort** ⛏️: Utilizes a binary heap data structure to sort elements.
- **Counting Sort** 📊: An integer sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each distinct element and uses this information to place elements into the sorted array.
- **Radix Sort** 🔢: Processes the input numbers digit by digit from least significant to most significant using a stable counting sort as a subroutine.
- **Bucket Sort** 🪣: Distributes elements into a number of buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates the sorted buckets.
